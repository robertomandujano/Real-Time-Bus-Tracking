# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking

* The Real-Time-Bus-Tracking exercise consists of using an API to source data from the Boston MBTA busses in real-time. This data is then used to display the multiple stops between MIT and Harvard on a map.

How to run

* Download the files from the Real-Time-Bus-Tracking repository, save them to a folder, and drag and drop the index.html file onto an empty webpage. Once the webpage has been populated, click on the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard button" to display all the stops made by the bus on the route between MIT and Harvard.

Future Improvements

* Potential improvements for this exercise consist of expanding the data displayed to include other bus routes as well as give the user the option to switch to a route for a different city with the use of a navigation bar.
